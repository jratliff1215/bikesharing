# CitiBike
Cycling is a popular methods of transportation in larger cities and metropolitan areas. This project utilizes CitiBike data (available to the public). A similar bike sharing program could be adopted in Des Moines. Using NYC CitiBike ridership program to get an idea of when people ride and how long they ride, a Tableau visualization was created and can be viewed here.

# Visuals
## Trip Duration

The most popular hours to ride are between 4PM and 6PM. This likely correlates with "rush hour" and departing work for home in the evening. As this commute can be more leisurely, a bike is likely a preferred option.

## Starting Times and Gender Considerations

Although the peak hours are in the evening, the morning hours also see a high usage of riders. This correlates with commute times. Gender plays little role in starting or end times. However, ridership can vary by gender by day, with more females riding on weekends and more males riding on weekdays. This will be a consideration in marketing in Des Moines.

## Single Ride or Membership?

The subscriber visual shows a larger number of male users. An understanding of the purpose of the ride would likely provide insight to why female subscribers are limited. An analysis of why a ride is completed will be needed.

## Start and End Locations

Manhattan is the most popular start (blue chart) and end (orange chart) location. This is likely due to population and ease of ride. Although ending location show an increase in suburbs of Manhattan, the majority of riders stay on the main island. This could be also be related to bike stations available or preferred distance.

# Des Moines Market

The Des Moines and Manhattan market are vastly different in preferred transportation. Manhattan is a mobile city with high use of public transport. The preferred transportation of Des Moines will need to be studied significantly prior to market entrance. Population, commute distance, and (sub)urban living preferences will be a large factor in the success of the Des Moines market.
