# CitiBike
Cycling is a popular methods of transportation in larger cities and metropolitan areas. This project utilizes CitiBike data (available to the public). A similar bike sharing program could be adopted in Des Moines. Using NYC CitiBike ridership program to get an idea of when people ride and how long they ride, a Tableau visualization was created and can be viewed here.
